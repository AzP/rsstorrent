I kinda need to add something here. Basically:

1. Download the files into a directory
2. Change the rsstorrent.py to be runnable (chmod +x rsstorrent.py or right-click it, choose properties and fix it there)
3. Copy the config file to ~/.rsstorrents/ and edit it there. The comments should be pretty self-explanatory. If this isn't done, rsstorrent will automatically copy the default config file to this place when run for the first time.
3.1 Set an RSS-feed to monitor. This might include your login and some hash-values generated by your site.
3.2 Set the directory to which you want to download your files
3.3 Add search patterns in a basic regular expression form. ".*" (without the quotes) is the wildcard to use. "." means any character and "*" means 0 or more occurrences of it. I'm using Python's regular expressions without manipulation.
3.4 Set your username and password to the torrent site, this is used to download the actual files.

Then start the script by doing
./rsstorrent.py

and after that you should be up'n'running. Over and out!
